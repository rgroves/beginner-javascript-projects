# Beginner JavaScript Projects

A series of very small projects meant for beginners to JavaScript.

All of these projects are meant to teach some aspect of client-side (within the broswer) JavaScript. This means that no backend component is necessaryâ€”you will be able to run these projects locally (on your own computer) inside of your browser. You also have the ability to publicly host the projects via any hosting service that offers simple hosting of static pages, like GitHub Pages.

It is best to build out these projects in the order listed below.
