  <h1>A Brief Tour of JavaScript Using The Developer Tools Console</h1>
  <p>This project is more an exploration of some of the basics you'll need to familiarize yourself with in order to
    build out the other projects in the series.</p>
  <p>You will not need any files for this project, instead you'll be using the browser's Developer Tools console to
    complete this exploration.</p>
  <p>The instructions listed here will be for Chrome, but should be similar in other browsers. You can access Developer
    Tools in most browsers by pressing F12. A couple of exceptions are as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Chrome for Mac uses <kbd>Cmd+Opt+J</kbd></li>
    <li>Safari uses <kbd>Cmd+Opt+C</kbd>
      <ul>
        <li>In Safari you must enable the Developer Console first</li>
        <li>Go into Preferences and under the Advanced tab check the box labeled "Show develop menu in menu bar"</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>

  <h3>Use JavaScript Do Some Math (Don't Worry Not A Lot)</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> Open Developer Tools in your browser and find and navigate to the Console tab.</li>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> Inside the Console you'll see a <samp>&gt;</samp> (greater than) symbol; this is the
      prompt where you will type in JavaScript code during this exploration.</li>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> After typing in some JavaScript you will need to hit enter to indicate that you have
      finished typing your code and submit it to be evaluated.</li>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> The code you submit will be evaluated (i.e. executed/ran) by the browser's JavaScript
      engine and will return a result of some kind.</li>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> At the prompt type in the following and hit enter:
      <pre class="code-text"><code>10 + 4</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> You should see <samp>&lt;- 14</samp> currently above the prompt. The symbol
      <samp>&lt;-</samp> means that what follows is the result of evaluating the previously entered JavaScript.</li>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> Try entering a few more mathematical expressions:
      <ul>
        <li><input type="checkbox" /> Exponentiation:
          <pre class="code-text"><code>10 ** 4</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" /> Multiplication:
          <pre class="code-text"><code>10 * 4</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" /> Division:
          <pre class="code-text"><code>10 / 4</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" /> Remainder:
          <pre class="code-text"><code>10 % 4</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" /> Addition:
          <pre class="code-text"><code>10 + 4</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" /> Subtraction:
          <pre class="code-text"><code>10 - 4</code></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> Here you are working with literal data (meaning the data just as you typed it) and
      performing mathematical operations with that data.</li>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> From a very simplistic point of view, the purpose of a program is to take some data
      and inspect it, transform it, and/or perform actions based upon it.</li>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> Using JavaScript as a basic calculator is like hammering a nail with a jackhammer.
      This isn't useful unless results can be stored and manipulated further. We do this with variables.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Learn About Variables</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> Declare a variable named <code>myNumber</code> using the <code>let</code> keyword:
      <pre class="code-text"><code>let myNumber;</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> Assign <code>myNumber</code> a value using the <code>=</code> (the assignment
      operator):
      <pre class="code-text"><code>myNumber = 10;</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> You can declare and assign a value in one step as well:
      <pre class="code-text"><code>let myNumber = 10;</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> Type the variable name <code>myNumber</code> into the console and hit enter. You'll
      see that this evaluates to the value the variable was assigned.</li>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> A variable's value can be changed any time in your code. Assign a different value to
      the <code>myNumber</code> variable:
      <pre class="code-text"><code>myNumber = 4;</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Learn About Data Types</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> So far we've been working with values that have a data type of Number. Variables may
      hold values that have different data types. Try declaring and initializing variables of the following types in the
      console (use the Example column as a guide) and examine their values as you did with <code>myNumber</code> above:
      <table class="table-sm table-striped">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th class="w-50">Example</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><input type="checkbox" /></td>
            <td>String</td>
            <td>A sequence of text enclosed in single or double quotes.</td>
            <td><code>let myString = "Hello";</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><input type="checkbox" /></td>
            <td>Number</td>
            <td>Numbers don't have quotes around them.</td>
            <td><code>let myNumber = 42;</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><input type="checkbox" /></td>
            <td>Boolean</td>
            <td>A true or false value. The keywords <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are special keywords that
              shouldn't have quotes around them.</td>
            <td><code>let myBoolean = true;</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><input type="checkbox" /></td>
            <td>Array</td>
            <td>A data structure that can store multiple values as a series of elements in a single reference.</td>
            <td><code>let myArray = ["Hello", 42, true, 0, "Goodbye"];</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><input type="checkbox" /></td>
            <td>Object</td>
            <td>This can be anything. <em>Everything in JavaScript is an object.</em> This is a key thing to keep in
              mind as you are learning JavaScript. An object can be initialized using a comma-delimited list of zero or
              more pairs of property names and associated values, enclosed in curly braces.</td>
            <td><code>let myObject = { "Greeting": "Hello", "Value": "7"};</code></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> Another important note to keep in mind: Mixing different types of data when performing
      calculations can sometimes lead to unexpected results. Try the code below and see what happens:
      <pre class="code-text"><code>30 + "5"</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Learn About Comments</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> Comments can be added to code to add notes to yourself or other developers. Comments
      are ignored and are not treated as code. Begin a single-line comment with two forward slashes followed by your
      comment text:
      <pre class="code-text"><code>// This is a comment</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> Multi-line comments can also be used. These start with a forward slash followed by an
      asterisk, then the comment text which can have line breaks in it, and then end with an asterisks followed by a
      forward slash:
      <pre class="code-text"><code>/* This comment 
   has three
   lines of text */
    </code></pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Learn About Conditional Statments</h3>

  <p>Conditional statements are used to execute certain code based on when an expression evaluates to true or false.</p>

  <h4>The <em>if...else</em> Statement</h4>
  <p>An if...else statement allows you to execute different code based upon a conditional test. In the example below, if
    the value of <code>myNumber</code> is greater than 10 then the first code block will be run, which adds 100 to
    myNumber. If the value of <code>myNumber</code> is not greater than 10 then the second code block will be run, which
    multiplies <code>myNumber</code> by 10. Only one of these code blocks will be run based upon the result of the
    conditional test.</p>
  <pre class="code-text"><code>
    if (myNumber &gt; 10) {
      myNumber = myNumber + 100;
    } else {
      myNumber = myNumber * 10;
    }
  </code></pre>

  <h3>Learn About Loops</h3>

  <h4>The <em>while</em> Loop</h4>

  <p>A while loop may execute a block of code multiple times as long as the conditional test specified evaluates to
    true. If the conditional test evaluates to false, the code block will not be run and execution of the program
    continues to the next statement after the while loop.</p>
  <p>In the example below, if <code>myNumber</code> is not greater than 10, then the code inside the while loop code
    block will not be executed. If the value of <code>myNumber</code> is greater than 10, the code block will execute
    and subtract 5 from <code>myNumber</code>. After, the condition is evaluated again and if still true will execute
    the code block again. This continues until the condition evaluates to false, at which point the program will
    continue with the next statement after the while loop.</p>
  <pre class="code-text"><code>
    while (myNumber &gt; 10) {
      myNumber = myNumber - 5;
    }
  </code></pre>

  <h4>The <em>do...while</em> Loop</h4>

  <p>A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, with the exception that the code block will always execute at least
    once, then the condition will be tested and if true will continue to run the code block over and over until the
    condition evaluates to false.</p>
  <p>In the example below, the code block is executed once, subtracting 5 from <code>myNumber</code>. After the block
    runs, the condition is tested and if true, the code block will execute again and subtract 5 from
    <code>myNumber</code>. This continues until the the condition evaluates to false, at which point the program will
    continue with the next statement after the do...while loop.</p>
  <pre class="code-text"><code>
    do  {
      myNumber = myNumber - 5;
    } while (myNumber &gt; 10);
  </code></pre>

  <h4>The <em>for</em> Loop</h4>

  <p>A for loop looks different from a while or do...while loop. Inside the parenthesis, there are three distinct parts.
    We'll use the example shown below to discuss these.</p>
  <pre class="code-text"><code>
      for (let i = 1; i &lt;= 3; i++)  {
        myNumber = myNumber + 5;
      };
    </code></pre>
  <ul>
    <li>The first part is an initialization, this is the <code>let i = 1;</code> part. This lets you setup a variable
      that
      can be used in the conditional test. The initialization runs first when the loop executes.</li>
    <li>The next part is the conditional test: <code>i &lt;= 3</code>. The result of this test determines if the for
      loop's
      code block will be executed, just like with the while and do...while loop.</li>
    <li>The last part, <code>i++</code>, is code that executes after each execution of the for loop's code block.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To put it all together, this is what happens with the for loop above. The variable <code>i</code> is declared and
    assigned a value of 1. The condition <code>i &lt;= 3</code> is evaluated and since <code>i</code> currently has a
    value of 1, and 1 is less than or equal to 3, the condition evaluates to true. This means that the for loop's code
    block will run, which will add 5 to
    <code>myNumber</code>. When the end of the code block is reached, the <code>i++</code> part of the for loop is
    executed which adds 1 to <code>i</code> making it's value 2. At this point the condition is tested again and since
    it is still true (2 is less than or equal to 3) the code block is executed again. This continues as described above
    until the value of <code>i</code> becomes 4, at which point the condition is no longer true and the program
    continues with the next statement after the for loop.
  </p>

  <h3>Learn About Functions</h3>

  <p>Functions allow you to package up some code that you can then reuse by calling the function instead of having to
    write the code over and over again when you need to use it. A function needs to be declared, like a variable. You
    do this with the <code>function</code> keyword followed by the function name. You can pass in values to a function
    so that you can use those values within the function's code, these values are called <em>arguments</em>. To define
    arguments, specify a name for each argument after the function name inside of parenthesis. If your function has no
    arguments you leave the inside of the parenthesis empty. After the arguments you specify a code block, which is any
    code you wish to execute inside of curly braces. Inside of your code block, you can use the <code>return</code>
    statement to return a value from your function. If you do not supply a return statement, the function will
    return<code>undefined</code>, which is the default value when there is not an explicit return value.</p>
  <pre class="code-text"><code>
      // Declare a function named add that accepts two arguments.
      // The first argument is named number1. The second argument is named number2.
      function add(number1, number2) {
        // The function will add number1 and number2 together and store the result.
        let result = number1 + number2;

        // The function then returns the stored result.
        return result;
      }
      
      // Call the add function, passing in the following values: 
      // 10 for number1 and 5 for number2. Store the value returned from the 
      // function in newNumber.
      let newNumber = add(10, 5);

      // After the previous line is executed, newNumber's value will be 15.
    </code></pre>

  <h3>Learn About Useful Objects</h3>

  <p>There are many useful pre-existing objects available to you in JavaScript. Listed below are a couple of them.</p>
  <p>You can access properties of an object. Properites may be data values or methods (a method is just some packaged
    functionality that you can call, exactly like a function). You access an object's data and methods using the <em>dot
      operator</em>, which is just a <code>.</code> that comes after the object name and before the property name.
    You'll see examples below to help make this clear.</p>

  <h4>The <em>console</em> Object</h4>

  <p>The console object allows you to interact with and send information to the browser's Developer Tools Console.
    Covered below is one of the most common methods used with the console object.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> Use the log method that is available on the console object to log a message to the
      console. Try this in the console:
      <pre class="code-text"><code>console.log("This is my message to be logged");</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>The <em>window</em> Object</h4>

  <p>The window object is the default global object when running JavaScript in the browser. You will learn more about
    this object as you start to learn more about JavaScript, for now we'll look at one method available on the window
    object.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><input type="checkbox" /> Use the alert method that is available on the window object to cause a dialog box to
      pop-up and alert the user:
      <pre class="code-text"><code>window.alert("This is my message to alert the user.");</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
