       One of your objectives is to take the code below, remove all of this 
       inline script, and make it an external file. 
    */

    /* You should get in the habit of using strict mode.
       This mode alerts you to when you might be using bad practices and will
       alert you to some errors that are normally treated as "silent" errors
       (i.e. errors that the JavaScript engine would not normally alert for).

       To put an entire script into strict mode you must include the following 
       string as the first (non-comment) statement of your script: "use strict";

    // Log the value of the userName variable.
    console.log("The value of userName is: " + userName);

    // Assign the userName variable a string value.
    userName = "World";

    // Declare and initialize the message variable with a concatenated string value.
    let message = "Hello " + userName + "!";

    // Create the alert to the user.
