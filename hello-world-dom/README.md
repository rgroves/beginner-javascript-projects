# Objectives

- [_] Open the page in your web browser and see what happens, then take a look at the main.js file in your editor.

- [_] Go read about the `document.querySelector` method to understand what it does and how to use it  
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector

- [_] Use `document.querySelector` to get the first paragraph element and store a reference to it in a variable named `greeting`.

- [_] Go read about the `innerText` property of an HTMLElement object.  
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/innerText

- [_] Use the innerText property of `greeting` to change the text displayed in the first paragraph on the web page to: "Hello World!"

- [_] Go read about the `document.getElementById` method to understand what it does and how to use it  
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById

- [_] Go read about the `innerHTML` property of an Element object.  
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML

- [_] Get a reference to the sole empty div element within the HTML document and assign it to a variable named mainDiv.

  `<img src="http://placekitten.com/300/300" class="img-fluid float-left rounded mr-5" alt="A cute kitty."/>`
